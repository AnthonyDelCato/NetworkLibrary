  - Routing basics
    - wide are network wans and 
    - local area network lans 
    - to router
    - need to configure logical network adress such as IPs
    - to get communicate via routers all host
    - transmission between hosts inside lans or wans
    - router find the best way
    - destination take the package and send information to the host again
    - network may also works without router and routing
    - to routing must have; - destination network adress
                            - neighbor routers to learn other network
                            - possible route to all network
                            - best route for each network
                            - how  to mainteain and verify routing inf
    - with these info build a ROUTING TABLE map of internetwork
    - if there is direct way or not
    - static routing / dynamic routing
    - fastethernet or serial
    - converger ir stady state is comlate info
  
  
  - IP routing Process
    - host router router destination;
    - forwarding IP packets
    - look for des is local or remmote; if remote use default gateway
    - arp -a check for address resolution table
    - ethernet frame; source mac, destination mac. source IP, destination IP
    - frame check sequence, FCS; router check for it
    - if fail drop, if pass, frame go to mac of des
    - de encapsulate of IP packet
    - check for header checksum
    - ...
     
  - if router doesnt know the dest info in the routing table it DISCARD the packets
      
  - Dynamic Routing Protocols; 
    - interior gagtway protocols IGPs, distance vector DV(RIP IGPR), link state LS (IS IS) 
    - exterior gateway protocols EGPs, popular one border gateway protocol BGP, ISPs use itt genreally
    - deff is autonomuous system AS
    - DR save time and energy
