- Topics - IP Routing
  - Routing basics
    - wide are network wans and 
    - local area network lans 
    - to router
    - need to configure logical network adress such as IPs
    - to get communicate via routers all host
    - transmission between hosts inside lans or wans
    - router find the best way
    - destination take the package and send information to the host again
    - network may also works without router and routing
    - to routing must have; - destination network adress
                            - neighbor routers to learn other network
                            - possible route to all network
                            - best route for each network
                            - how  to mainteain and verify routing inf
    - with these info build a ROUTING TABLE map of internetwork
    - if there is direct way or not
    - static routing / dynamic routing
    - fastethernet or serial
    - converger ir stady state is comlate info
  
  
  - IP routing Process
    - host router router destination;
    - forwarding IP packets
    - look for des is local or remmote; if remote use default gateway
    - arp -a check for address resolution table
    - ethernet frame; source mac, destination mac. source IP, destination IP
    - frame check sequence, FCS; router check for it
    - if fail drop, if pass, frame go to mac of des
    - de encapsulate of IP packet
    - check for header checksum
    - ...
     
  - if router doesnt know the dest info in the routing table it DISCARD the packets
      
  - Dynamic Routing Protocols; 
    - interior gagtway protocols IGPs, distance vector DV(RIP IGPR), link state LS (IS IS) 
    - exterior gateway protocols EGPs, popular one border gateway protocol BGP, ISPs use itt genreally
    - deff is autonomuous system AS
    - DR save time and energy
    - 
    
    
  - Practise;
    - IANA give an IP adress; 195.168.10.0/24, 
    - in the normal office local network calculate the ports for phsycal infrastructure
    - with virtual routers on AWS, gonna build a VPC which IP adres 195.168.10.0/24
    - for nedded each network branch gonna bulid sub VPCs and their IPs start with 195.168.10....
    - last octet will use for subnett id and host id
    - subnet mask / binary  / 11000011.10101000.00001010.11100000  >  195.168.10.0  / 27 
    - subnet mask / decimal / 255.255.255.224
    - 
    - 11000011.10101000.00001010.00000000 
    - 195.168.10.0                            subnet ID                      first host adres  last  host ID      broadcast
    - 11000011.10101000.00001010.000 00000 / 195.168.10.0       > not use   
    - 11000011.10101000.00001010.001 00000 / 195.168.10.32/27  > av subnet / 195.168.10.33/27 / 195.168.10.62 / 195.168.10.63 /27 
    - 11000011.10101000.00001010.010 00000 / 195.168.10.64/27  > av subnet / 195.168.10.65/27 / 195.168.10.94 / 195.168.10.95   /27    
    - 11000011.10101000.00001010.011 00000 / 195.168.10.96/27  > av subnet / 195.168.10.97/27 / 195.168.10.126 /195.168.10.127  /27 
    - 11000011.10101000.00001010.100 00000 / 195.168.10.128/27 > av subnet / 195.168.10.129/27 / 195.168.10.158 /195.168.10.159  /27 
    - 11000011.10101000.00001010.101 00000 / 195.168.10.160/27 > av subnet / 195.168.10.161/27 / 195.168.10.190 /195.168.10.191   /27 
    - 11000011.10101000.00001010.11/27 
    - 11000011.10101000.00001010.111 00000 /  195.168.10.224/27  > not use                                 


  - VPS;
     - routing table;
       - public IP > 10.0.0.0/16 all include > 10.0.0.0/24, 10.0.1.0/24 and 10.0.2.0/24 sub VPC 
       -                         private IP4 > 10.0.0.5,    10.0.1.5         10.0.2.5
       - some vps are no gateway to internet
       - some vps has connection to internet
       - these are build by the custom route table
       - by writing gateway or deleting gateway
       - AWS auto generate gateway with main route table
       - 
     - 0.0.0.0/0 everyone reach gateway id number, any host any network, from everywhere
     - ::/0 accept all rquest by dehors, anyone can reach me
     - if there is no gateway not connect everywhere just in local network reach it
     - .
     - h1 check for its own ip and subnetmas with h2's ip and subnet masks and reognize if h1 and h2 in the same network or not
     - if it is antoher newwork it has to be add mac adress to check is h2 mc known? if not use default gateway mac au lieu de h2 mac's
     -  check frame for FCS if fail drom or pass
     -  if k take packets to check checksum if ok pass or drop
     -  look dest network id if it is avaliable from any router k send it by these router
     -  if tehre is no info about dest network it has to be ask fot this networks infor for nearest routersn and find a way to go
     -  find dest newt id and take the packege and decrease TTL by 1 
     -  frame the package again and send it to dest newtwork with known dest netwotk id with make a frame by looking ARP table to check dest mac if there is no mac adrss of next routr it has to be update ARp by broadcasting to ask the router known ip send me ypur mac to save its mac and keep continue
     -  default TTL change depend os, it nearly 255 some upper some lowe you can change if you want
     -  host has to be check arp tabel  for if  dest is in the sam network are; if it is use dest ip sinon use default gateway ip
     -  router check for ethernet frame for FCS is correct pass or drop
     -  router check for dest mac, des broadcast adres, multicast for router lsitener.
     -  de encapsulation
     -  check routing tabel
     -  decrease TTL
     -  encapsulate
     -  check arp table dest ip or next hop ip
     -  send frame
  - Every VPC has to be a routing table and it has to be organized by cloud architect
  - while dest designing look route table
  - while build frame look arp table
