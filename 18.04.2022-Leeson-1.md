	- IPv4 
	- 132.212.232.22 is an public IP adress

	- Private IP
	- Calculation IP to Subnet Mask to Private IP
	- CIDR classless inter domain routing

IP to Subnet Mask Example 1
- IP; 165.72.83.194/19  > 16 + 3
- 128  64  32  16  8   4   2   1   > take 3 from left as 32 is a key for us
- 128 192 224 240 248 252 254 255  > equal of 32 is 224 so 224 is a Subnets 3th octet
- 165.72.83.194 > 83 is a key for us
- Subnet Mask : 255.255.224.0
- 1th Network = 0							Network   ; 165.72.64.0
- 2th Network = 32						Broadcast ; 165.72.95.255
- 3th Network = 64 > 83				Firsth IP ; 165.72.64.1	
- 4th Network = 96						Last IP   ; 165.72.95.254
- 5th Network = 128 


IP to Subnet Mask Example 2
- IP; 87.121.165.49/14  > 8 + 6
- 128  64  32  16  8   4   2   1   > take 6 from left as 4 is a key for us
- 128 192 224 240 248 252 254 255  > equal of 4 is 252 so 252 is a Subnets 3th octet
- 87.121.165.49 > 121 is a key for us
- Subnet Mask : 255.255.224.0
- 1th Network = 116							Network   ; 87.120.0.0
- 2th Network = 120	> 121				Broadcast ; 87.123.255.255
- 3th Network = 124  						Firsth IP ; 87.120.0.1	
- 4th Network = 128							Last IP   ; 87.123.255.254
- 5th Network = 132 


Binary Format of IP and Newwork ID and Subnet MAsk
00000000.00000000.00000000.00000000 is 4 octet
00000001.00000001.00000001.00000001 is 1.1.1.1 IP
10000000.10000000.10000000.10000000 is 128.128.128.128 IP
11111111.11111111.11111111.11111111 is 255.255.255.255 IP

132.87.43.0/20											> IANA gives IP Class B or C forst 20 bits not change
10000100.01010111.0010111.00000000  > IP
255.255.240.0												> Sunnet Mask
11111111.11111111.1111000.00000000  > Subnet Mask
10000100.01010111.0010000.00000000  > 132.87.32.0 Network ID logical calculation result gives us this 




Basic Idea of Subnetting Lesson
- It is enough to understand an IP and its /20 (CDIR part means what).
- Amazon Virtual Private Cloud gives automatically some Network ID and understand and organize it manually is important.
