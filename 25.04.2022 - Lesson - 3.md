    - Adress Resoulution Protocol (ARP)
      - translate TCP/IP adress to MAC adress by using broadcast
      - ask who is IP adress 111.1111.111.111 and get MAC adres
      - ARP table is producing like that for all the network
      - windows cached it in emory
      - ARP tables has Dynamic or Static entries
      - if MAC not found in table ask and learn it Dynamic
      - before asking just learning by request to send data and host send data is static
      - arp is a windows command for checking cached arp tables
      - arp -a for mac adreses and ip adress lookup tabl
